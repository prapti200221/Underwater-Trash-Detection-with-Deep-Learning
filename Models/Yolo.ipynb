        "To address the issue of class imbalance in the underwater trash detection dataset, we first identify the underrepresented object classes (such as masks, ropes, tubes, and fragments) based on their lower occurrence in the training data. We create dedicated output folders to store augmented data separately. Then, a data augmentation strategy is implemented where, for every image containing one of these rare classes, random transformations are applied — including horizontal flipping and brightness adjustment. These techniques help to synthetically increase the diversity of the dataset without altering the original content of the images, making the model more robust to different lighting and orientation conditions typically encountered underwater. The augmented images and their corresponding labels are saved into new directories. Afterward, we merge both the original dataset and the augmented dataset into a single combined folder, ensuring that the model has access to a rich, balanced set of examples for training."

        "Following this preparation, we train a YOLOv8n model, starting from pre-trained weights (yolov8n.pt) to leverage prior learning. We use a comprehensive training strategy where 50 epochs are set, with a standard input image size of 640×640 pixels. The training further benefits from several types of real-time augmentations during learning, such as color shifts (hsv adjustments), image flipping (flipud, fliplr), and more advanced techniques like mosaic and mixup to create variations between images dynamically. A dropout rate of 0.15 is used to reduce overfitting, and early stopping with a patience of 10 epochs is introduced to halt training if no meaningful improvement is detected. The model training outputs are organized under a specified project directory on Google Drive, making it easier to access and evaluate the results.\n"

        "After successfully training the YOLOv8 model, we move on to the prediction phase. In this block, we use the model.predict function to apply our trained model to the test images and evaluate its performance. The source parameter points to the folder containing the test images (/content/ocean_waste_yolo/test/images) on which we want to make predictions. Each image is resized to 640×640 pixels (imgsz=640) to match the training input size, ensuring consistency in feature extraction. The save=True argument ensures that all the prediction results — including bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores are saved automatically. These outputs are organized under the specified project directory on Google Drive, grouped neatly under a subfolder named yolov8_ocean_final_pred. During execution, the model processes each test image one by one and outputs predictions such as detected objects (e.g., plastic bag, cup, wrapper) along with the processing speed for each image. This detailed logging provides insight into both the detection results and the computational efficiency of the model. Overall, this prediction step validates how well the fine-tuned model can correctly identify and classify different types of marine waste in underwater scenes."

        "In this final step, we visualize the model's predictions to qualitatively assess its performance. The code first gathers all the .jpg prediction images saved during the prediction phase from the project directory (/content/drive/MyDrive/yolov8_results/yolov8_ocean_final_pred) using the glob function, allowing recursive search through subdirectories. It then prints the total number of prediction images found, giving a quick confirmation that the prediction phase has successfully generated outputs. If predicted images are found, one image is randomly selected and displayed using IPImage from the IPython display module. This allows us to visually inspect how well the model is detecting and classifying marine debris, with bounding boxes and class labels clearly drawn on the images. If no images are found, an appropriate error message is printed. This step is for quick manual verification to ensure that different types of trash are being detected correctly and consistently by the model."
